Probably my aim is not to show off or grab someone's attention, but to find all the possible ways to make a single rupee that can also turn into my wealth or my savings.

There's a raw honesty in admitting what you want. Society often tells us to be humble about our desires, especially around money. But I've found that clarity about your goals—no matter how simple or materialistic they might seem—is actually a superpower.

## What I Want

I want money so badly—not for hoarding, but to spend it as much as I want on the things that bring genuine joy:

- **Food** — That makes me happy and feeds my soul. Not just sustenance, but experiences. The kind of meals that become memories.

- **Clothes** — That make me feel confident and good about myself. Not to impress others, but because there's power in feeling put together.

- **Hobbies** — That fuel my passion and creativity. The things I'd do even if no one was watching, even if they never made me a penny.

- **Experiences** — That create lasting memories. Travel, concerts, random Tuesday adventures. Life is too short for monotony.

> I don't want wealth for the future; it's for living fully in the present with the people I love.

I want to travel, explore, drive through new places, and **learn lifelong**. Not because society expects it, not to tick boxes off some imaginary checklist, but because it makes life worth living. There's something profound about seeing new places, meeting new people, understanding that your way of life is just one of billions.

## A Small Gift to Myself

Having my own stuff is not a big wish but just a small gift to myself for every drop of sweat I've given. It's a reward for the late nights, the early mornings, the failures that nobody saw, and the persistence that nobody applauded.

We often wait for others to validate our efforts. We wait for recognition, for promotions, for someone to notice. But the truth is, sometimes the only person who truly knows how hard you've worked is you. And that's okay. That's actually beautiful.

Trying to make the best out of yourself and surprising people—that's the goal. Not to prove anything to anyone, but to prove to yourself that you can do it. That the limits you thought were real were just illusions.

## What Truly Brings Joy

I love kids. Making them laugh gives me more happiness than anything else in this world. There's something magical about their genuine reactions, their unfiltered joy. They haven't learned to be cynical yet. They haven't built walls. They just... feel.

**You being a superhero to someone younger than you gives you a lot more dopamine rush than anyone else could.**

Whether it's teaching them something new, making them laugh with a silly joke, or just being present—those moments are priceless. They remind you what really matters. In a world obsessed with productivity and metrics, children remind us that sometimes the most valuable things can't be measured.

## The Journey

Life isn't a straight path. It's messy, unpredictable, and beautiful in its chaos. You never know where the next opportunity will come from, what skill will suddenly become valuable, or which random connection will change everything.

That's terrifying. But it's also incredibly freeing.

**Just learning and doing. Let's see where it takes me.**

That's my philosophy. No grand plans that lock me into one direction. No pressure to have everything figured out by some arbitrary deadline. Just show up every day, learn something new, build something meaningful, and trust that the dots will connect looking backward.

Steve Jobs was right about that—you can only connect the dots looking backward. So why stress about whether they'll make sense? Just keep collecting dots.

## The Uncertainty Is The Point

We're taught to fear uncertainty. To crave stability. To plan decades ahead. But some of the best things in my life happened because I didn't know what I was doing. Because I was open to possibilities. Because I said yes to things that scared me.

You never know. That's not a weakness—it's a feature. The unknown is where growth lives.

*Life isn't about the destination—it's about collecting moments, learning constantly, and being someone's hero along the way.*
