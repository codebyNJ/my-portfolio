This project began in a strangely literal place: my hostel washroom. It sounds funny, but that’s where the idea took root — to write a fiction story using ChatGPT and test how well generative AI could create emotionally resonant narrative.

I treated the experiment seriously. I studied the landscape of generative AI and completed a few short courses that helped me understand the practical mechanics and responsible use of these models. A few of the short courses I found useful were:

- Introduction to Generative AI — Google Cloud Skill Boost
- Introduction to Large Language Models — Google Cloud Skill Boost
- Introduction to Responsible AI — Google Cloud Skill Boost
- Chat-GPT for Everyone — GUVI

My goal was to challenge the model with the genre of love — a domain dense with subtle emotions, which I thought would be a good test for an LLM (especially GPT-3.5, which is trained up to January 2022). I wanted the story to feel true to human experience, to be relatable even years later.

I set a few ground rules for the process:

- Build character development from the ground up (basic traits, motivations, emotional arcs).
- Keep the whole development inside a single chat session to maintain continuity.
- Use detailed, carefully written prompts; small grammar errors in prompts can derail the output.

I started with a vague instruction: "write a love story where there are two main characters and two sub-characters who create an impact with a lot of emotions, where the protagonist recovers from a broken state of life." The first output was short — a couple of pages — and it didn’t expand easily when I asked it to.

I persisted. After experimenting with many prompts I discovered a pattern: the tone and phrasing of my prompts mattered. Treating the model with kinder, softer language often yielded richer emotional detail; harsher prompts produced blunt, less nuanced text. I also learned to treat the model like a collaborator: I described scenes in detail and iteratively requested expansions, focusing on one scene at a time.

Handling multiple characters posed a challenge. The model handled two characters well, but managing a larger cast required careful scaffolding and repeated clarifications. I drafted a flowchart of character relationships, and used it to guide prompts so the story maintained coherence.

After a few days, the model produced a complete book — roughly 100 pages and about 15,000 words. Formatting and chapter layout were manual steps I handled myself. For the title, chapter names, and cover image I again used generative tools; the final cover font work I did manually in Photoshop.

Before publishing, I was concerned about AI-content detectors and platform policies. I tested the book with several publication and e-book platforms; despite being AI-assisted, it passed their checks and was accepted for sale.

I also ran a small social experiment: I gave the book to some friends and colleagues to read without telling them it was AI-written. Most readers (about 95%) related to the emotional beats and found the story authentic — which was the point of the experiment.

That outcome raised an interesting tension. On one hand, AI can amplify a writer’s output, help with vocabulary, structure, and emotional calibration. On the other hand, it raises concerns among creators: if an AI can generate convincing emotions and narratives, what does that mean for the craft and for attribution?

My take: generative AI is a tool. Used responsibly, it can be a valuable collaborator that augments creativity. It doesn’t replace human judgment or lived experience. Instead, it helps scale ideas, surface phrasing, and offer variations — with the key caveat that a human must curate, edit, and own the final voice.

If you’re experimenting with AI-written fiction, here are a few pragmatic tips I used:

- Keep continuity in a single chat session when possible.
- Build clear character profiles and a story outline before asking the model to expand scenes.
- Iterate on tone: small prompt changes can produce big differences in emotional color.
- Use external tools for formatting and cover art; own the final presentation.
- Share early drafts with trusted readers before publication.

In the end, the project confirmed that AI can be a surprisingly empathetic writing partner — if you guide it carefully. The conversation between human intent and machine generation produced something that readers could feel.

Generative AI will continue to change how stories are written. The choice for a writer is not whether to use the tool, but how carefully and transparently to integrate it into the craft.
